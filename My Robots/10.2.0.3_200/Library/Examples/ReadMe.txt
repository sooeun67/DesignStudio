Welcome to the Examples folder.

This folder contains a selection of example Robots, Types and Snippets.
We urge you to open the examples and study them. Each file demonstrates a
different feature of Design Studio and by reading the descriptions and
comments, you will learn how to implement the same ideas in your own projects.

To get started, open START_HERE.robot in the Robots folder.
Once the robot is open, click the blue square which reads "CLICK HERE FIRST".
